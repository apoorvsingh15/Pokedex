# POKEDEX

## DESCRIPTION

A random react project which renders list of various pokemons across different generations and lets you search
through them.

## LIBRARIES USED

- React.js
- Material-ui
- Fuse.js

## Added Note

Have you ever wondered or been questioned about as to how to pass data from a child to parent component in react. React as we all know is unidirectional but still sometimes we have to pass the data in opposite direction. Well this is done in this project. You can easily see the source code and realize that this is one of the ways you could do the above by not using redux at all. React in itself is powerful enough to make complex applicatons but redux makes in way easier to maintain state in react apps.
